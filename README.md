# nnn-plugins

A collection of personal nnn plugins that I find useful.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> These are only tested on Linux on my personal system. I make no guarantee as to their portability or stability on other environments.

## Installation

To use these plugins, download the scripts to your `nnn` plugins directory (usually `~/.config/nnn/plugins`).
